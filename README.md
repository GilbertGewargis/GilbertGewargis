ðŸ’« About Me:

Hi! I'm Gilbert â€” a passionate and curious developer based in Australia.  
I'm currently studying **Computer Science** with a strong focus on **software engineering**, and I love building things that are fast, secure, and intuitive.

I enjoy working with modern web technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**, and I'm expanding into **backend development** with **Java**.
